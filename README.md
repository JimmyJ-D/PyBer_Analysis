#Overview of the analysis:
Explain the purpose of the new analysis
We have been asked to analysis the collected data of PyBer_Ride_Share and provide a breakdown of key numbers by city type. PyBer_Ride_Share have collected data from the three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural where they have business footprint. Each of these city types have the fare cost, number of drivers, and number of patrons. We will use Python, Matploylib, Scipy, and Numby to construct data-frames and graphs to represent the totals and averages from the three city types and present them visually. 



#Results:
From the three city types PyBer Ride Share collected data from the Urban category produced the largest amount of fares collected. While Urban has the largest amount of fares collected, its Average Fare Per Ride and Average Fare Per Driver were the least. As we continue to exam the data, we see that the Rural City type has the fewest total rides and total drivers but has the largest average fare per driver. The Suburban city type was statistically in the median of all measured categories.

#Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendation to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Using sample data from January to May, it correlates with our average and total amount data. The rural cities are service by the fewest driver but has the largest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. We would recommend increasing the total drivers in the rural city to capitalize on the largest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. We recommend on reducing the number of drivers in the urban city and possibility increasing prices.
